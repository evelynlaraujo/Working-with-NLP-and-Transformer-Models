# Working-with-NLP-and-Transformer-Models

In these projects, from CS154, I trained and utilized a transformer model (via huggingface) to experiment with natural language processing, such as sentence and doument sentiments, summarization and topic modeling. The process can be seen in the project4a.ipynb, project4b.ipynb and project5.ipynb files and the code in spacy_on_corpus.py file. Additionally, the server file allows this code to be applied to the Anvil web app with the appropriate additions within Anvil. Note: all the code can (and has been) run within this codespace as well.
