# Working-with-NLP-and-Transformer-Models

In this project, I trained and utilized a transformer model (via huggingface) to analyze sentence sentiment in a series of sentences. The process can be seen in the project_5.ipynb file and the code in spacy_on_corpus.py file. Additionally, the server file allows this code to be applied to the Anvil web app with the appropriate additions within Anvil.
